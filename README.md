## BME688-ESP32-SPI-MAIN ##
This repository contains SPI drivers and example code for the Bosch Sensortec BME688 temperature, pressure, humidity and gas sensor unit.

As of 1/8/2024 it is a work in process. This is my first venture into writing a driver for any hardware on any platform. I am a hardware engineer and I am wanting to step into the unknown of coding. This repository has been written in VS Code with the ESP IDF. If you happen to pull this repository and have some feedback on how I can improve it, please feel free to let me know. You can contact me at : michaelshanedawson@gmail.com

### CHANGELOG ###
v0.1 1/8/2024 - Initial workable version compiled and tested.
